# Overview of the Task  

## Objective of the Task
- To create a user-friendly to-do list web app

## Technologies used
- HTML : For designing the basic layout of the web page
- CSS : For designing the web page
- JS : For adding responsiveness and interactivity to the web page

## Task implementation
I am a beginner in the field of web development, and doing this project helped me a lot to understand the practical application of HTML tags, CSS selectors and JavaScript. Since my internship is focused on front-end web development, I have used local storage in the browser to store that tasks being created in the to-do list.  
When the website is opened, the main page displayed is :

The tasks can be written in the input field for entering the tasks and can be saved in the to-do list by clicking on the ADD button.

Each task created has two options - on clicking the task, it gets checked as done in the to-do list and a "X" symbol, which when clicked, deletes the task from the to-do list.

As I improve my knowledge and skills in web development, I look forward to refining my projects and create new projects.
